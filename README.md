## Tabella Backend Challenge

We'll evaluate everything you accomplish, and every part of your code will be reviewed, so don’t worry if you don’t fully complete it.

One of the most common scenarios that companies find is sending mass emails. It is valuable for any company to maintain a good relationship with its users.

We need you to develop an API that stores and sends emails. It’ll have the following endpoints:

| METHOD | PATH | DESCRIPTION |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| POST | /emails  | Add email to list of outgoing emails  |
| GET | /emails | List outgoing emails  |
| PATCH | /emails/:id | Mark email as unsubscribed  |
| POST | /submissions | Send emails |
| GET | /submissions | List submissions |

Feel free to model this data however you want, as long as you meet the requirements described in each endpoint.

You can use [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) for sending the emails or any other service you might prefer.

----

When you’re done with the API, you can optionally enhance your project by adding:

- A basic frontend for displaying everything (don’t stress too much with CSS);
- Celebrate for data validation on endpoints.

----

Technology requirements:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)

Don't get hung up on concepts you might not know yet. Our analysis will be according to your level.

Good luck!
